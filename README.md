# Passport Toolbox

An offline-first everyday toolbox for the **FoloToy AI Passport** wearable
(ESP32-C3, 240 × 320 portrait LCD, three physical buttons). It is a derivative
application built on the repository's hardware-test baseline: the reusable board
logic in `components/bsp` is kept, while the application screens, navigation,
visual design, and button behaviour are designed from scratch for this product.

The product goal is simple: the device must stay useful when there is no network.
Calendar, routine countdowns, Pomodoro focus, badge, and the offline TOTP
passcode all work with no connection at all. The only online module is the
League of Legends esports centre, and it degrades to a clearly labelled local
cache when the network is unavailable.

The full requirements, interaction rules, and acceptance criteria are in the
[product requirements document](docs/product/passport-toolbox-prd.md); a
scrollable, interactive screen prototype ships beside it as
[`passport-toolbox-ui-prototype.html`](docs/product/passport-toolbox-ui-prototype.html).

## What the application does

| Area | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Home | The badge card and the desk-pet card above a module carousel of eight entries, with a status bar and a per-page button hint bar. |
| Time and calendar | Gregorian calendar with Chinese lunar date, solar term and daily advice; a five-scale time-progress view (day / week / month / year / life); stopwatch and countdown timer. |
| Focus and efficiency | Pomodoro timer with configurable focus and break lengths and power-loss-safe records; up to 16 local reminders with weekday repeat. |
| Routine and countdown | Per-weekday schedule nodes with odd/even week support, current-node highlighting, and a large countdown to the next node. Node names are freely chosen — on the device from a preset subject list, on the phone configuration page as any text. |
| Identity and tools | Up to five badge cards with an offline QR code; offline RFC 6238 TOTP showing the current code, its remaining validity, and the next code; hardware self-test. |
| LoL esports centre | Today's and this week's schedule, live scores, standings, teams, and per-game detail, ordered by a fixed priority and served from cache first. |
| Novel | One UTF-8 plain-text novel (up to ~1 MB) uploaded from the phone configuration page, read offline page by page with an auto-detected chapter list and a remembered reading position. |
| System | Wi-Fi provisioning (SoftAP web page and BLE), time sync, screen-off and power saving, theme, sound, followed teams, and data backup/erase. |

## Offline-first design

- Every screen except the esports centre and time sync is reachable and usable
  with no network. There is no "connect to continue" blocking page.
- All user data (badges, routine, reminders, Pomodoro state, followed teams,
  TOTP secrets, esports cache) is stored locally in NVS.
- The esports centre renders the cached result first, then refreshes in the
  background, and labels the data freshness when offline.
- The interface is Chinese; the application ships a generated CJK bitmap font
  and a coverage check so no label or user-supplied name renders as a missing
  glyph.

## Hardware capability contract

| Capability | Confirmed implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Display | ST7789P3, 240 × 320 portrait RGB565, SPI, LEDC backlight |
| Input | `UP`, `DOWN`, `OK` on one ADC resistor ladder (GPIO0); no combination keys |
| Audio | ES8311 codec over I2S, playback and capture |
| Battery | CW2017 fuel gauge (state of charge and voltage) |
| Wi-Fi | 2.4 GHz STA, used only by the esports centre, provisioning, and time sync |
| Bluetooth LE | NimBLE peripheral, used only for provisioning |
| Storage | NVS on 8 MB Flash, no PSRAM |

All pins, addresses, and panel parameters are read from
[`components/bsp/include/bsp_pins.h`](components/bsp/include/bsp_pins.h);
application code does not duplicate hardware constants.

## Build and test

ESP-IDF **5.5.3** for ESP32-C3 is required. See the
[environment bootstrap](docs/development/engineering/environment-setup.md) and
[build and test](docs/development/engineering/build-and-test.md) guides.

```bash
./tools/validate.sh --static     # repository checks + host-side logic tests
./tools/validate.sh --firmware   # ESP-IDF build + merged-image verification
./tools/validate.sh              # complete gate (requires activated ESP-IDF 5.5.3)
```

The firmware gate produces the verified merged image at
`build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin`, which is flashed at offset `0x0`.

A successful build is not hardware validation. Report build results, host-test
results, device-test results, and unverified checks separately.

## Delivery status

The verified merged image is committed for delivery at
[`dist/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin`](dist/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin), with its
checksum in [`dist/SHA256SUMS`](dist/SHA256SUMS). The single file covers the
bootloader, partition table, and application, and is written at offset `0x0`.

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
    write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 8MB \
    0x0 dist/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin
```

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Firmware build and merged-image verification | PASS |
| Repository checks and host-side logic tests | PASS |
| On-device tests | NOT RUN — needs a connected board and approval to flash |
| Unverified | On-device rendering and CJK glyph coverage, the desktop pet's motion feel and status-bar silhouette legibility, the novel reader's pagination and chapter list on a real screen, novel upload over the device hotspot, the real-world tracker classification hit rate, BLE provisioning end to end, live esports data and its offline fallback, odd/even routine switching after time sync, power behaviour |

`dist/` is a delivery snapshot: rerunning the firmware gate refreshes `build/`
only, so refresh `dist/` and its checksum deliberately. Light sleep and deep
sleep are not part of this delivery; automatic screen-off and the power-saving
option are implemented.
